/**
 * Variable Declaration by using special characters (var, let, const)
 * assign values to declared variables

/**
 * Declare a variable called 'Country','continent' and 'population' and assign their values according to your favourite country
 * and log their values (HINT: console.log() )
 */

// whenever you get a big problem, never get scared instead try to divide 1 big problem into multiple small problems and you will see a way out!

////////////////////////////////// Data-Types ///////////////////////////////////////////////
/**
 * there are 7 primitives data types
 *
 * 1: Number: used for decimal and integer
 * Ex: let age = 23
 *
 * 2: String: Sequence of characters, used for decimal, integers, characters, words etc...
 * Ex: let name = 'Kevin', "Amit", `Monal`
 *
 * 3: Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false (1 = true, 0 = false);
 * Ex: var elidgibleForDriving = true;
 *
 * 4: undefined: a value which is not defined
 * Ex: let numbers;
 *
 * 5: Null: a empty value
 * Ex: let kev = null;
 *
 * 6: Symbol (ES2015) : value that is unique and cannot be changed
 *
 * 7: BigInt (ES2020): an intiger which is larger than the number can hold
 *
 * Note: java script has dynamic typing: we do no have to manully define the datatype of the value;
 *
